# Database and migrations

SQLite is the durable local source of truth for run history and reports. Kysely provides typed queries; migrations remain plain forward-only SQL.

## Storage boundary

The default database is `data/agent-automation-score.sqlite`, which is ignored by Git. `AGENT_AUTOMATION_SCORE_DB_PATH` may point tests or packaged builds at another local file. Renamed installations continue using an existing `data/repo-automation-score.sqlite` when the new file is absent; `REPO_AUTOMATION_SCORE_DB_PATH` remains a deprecated compatibility alias so local history is not orphaned.

The database stores repository names and Git revisions, never absolute repository paths. It stores prepared prompts and normalized evidence, not byte-for-byte provider transcripts or private chain-of-thought.

## Schema ownership

| Tables | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `runs`, `run_agent_setup` | Request, repository revision, provider configuration, status, and timestamps |
| `run_attempts` | Independent repetitions or retries |
| `run_passes` | Initial work and ordered review loops within an attempt |
| `pass_token_usage`, `pass_phases`, `pass_events` | Usage and bounded execution history |
| `pass_checks`, `pass_changes` | Verification and changed-file evidence |
| `pass_evaluations` | Score at a specific pass |
| `structural_findings`, `implementation_findings`, `execution_findings` | What was missing, built, or inefficient |
| `run_recommendations` | Evidence-linked documentation, skill, workflow, testing, or architecture improvements |
| `attempt_summary`, `run_summary` | Read models for reports and comparisons |
| `sessions`, `session_sources`, `session_repositories` | Provider-neutral observed-session identity, coverage, synchronization, and optional revision context |
| `session_threads`, `session_turns` | Orchestrator/subagent hierarchy and per-turn model attribution |
| `turn_usage_snapshots`, `session_events` | Periodic usage and bounded normalized live evidence with replay keys |
| `session_checks`, `session_changes` | Verification and repository-relative change evidence observed during a session |
| `session_summary` | Durable session watermarks, counts, and latest per-turn usage projection |

Live session state is rendered from memory rather than by polling SQLite after every provider event. Routine evidence is transaction-batched; lifecycle events, idle, shutdown, and terminal transitions flush immediately. `observed_sequence` and `durable_sequence` expose whether a renderer snapshot includes evidence that is not yet committed. Source event keys and sync cursors advance transactionally so reconnect replay cannot duplicate evidence or skip past a failed write.

Token counts are nullable and carry a measurement classification. Unavailable imported usage remains `NULL`; it is never projected as zero. Session rows do not require repository or benchmark fields. Existing `runs`, attempts, and passes remain the controlled Benchmark Lab subtype rather than being overloaded for observed sessions.

## Migration contract

Migration files live under `backend/db/migrations/` and use `YYYY-MM-DD_#_description.sql`. They run in lexical order and are tracked in `schema_migrations` with a SHA-256 checksum.

- Never edit or rename a migration after it has been applied outside a confirmed disposable local database.
- Encode stable invariants with foreign keys, unique constraints, checks, and indexes.
- Preserve history deliberately when choosing cascade or deletion behavior.
- Keep each migration transactionally complete and add a new forward migration for later corrections.
- Update `backend/src/db/database.ts` when the typed schema changes; use `npm run db:types` only when the generator is configured against the intended database.

## Commands

```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:status
npm run db:import-results
```

`db:import-results` is the idempotent, one-time compatibility path for unimported `results/web-runs` history. Verify normalized records before deleting the ignored legacy input. Database and WAL files remain untracked. SQLite is the only durable application store; web-managed raw provider output is removed after successful normalization, while standalone CLI diagnostics remain at their printed path until the operator removes them.
